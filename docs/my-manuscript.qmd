# Meet the `boys` data 

The `boys` data from the `mice` package in `R` is a random sample of 10% from the cross-sectional data used to construct the Dutch growth references 1997. Variables `gen` and `phb` are ordered factors. `reg` is a factor.

The following table shows the first 6 rows of the `boys` data.

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
head(mice::boys)
```

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
head(boys)
```

Not every value in the `mice::boys` set is observed. This may pose problems with the analysis of the `boys` data. To get an idea about the problem, we can use missing data patterns. created the [`ggmice`](https://github.com/amices/ggmice){.pkg} package to create a [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org){.pkg} [@ggplot2] type plot of the missing values in the `boys` data.

```{r mdpattern}
library(mice)
library(ggmice)

# visualize ggplot2-like missing data pattern
mice::boys |> 
  ggmice::plot_pattern()
```
